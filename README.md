# Desktop Automation Learning
A practice project to explore computer vision and desktop automation using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter.

## Features
- Region-based screen detection with OpenCV
- Automated clicking & key press (PyAutoGUI, Pynput)
- GUI with Tkinter (Start/Stop, advanced settings)
- JSON-based configuration
- License validation with Fernet encryption + HMAC

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- OpenCV, MSS, NumPy (image processing & screen capture)
- PyAutoGUI, Pynput (automation & hotkeys)
- Tkinter (GUI)
- pytesseract (OCR)
- threading (multithreading)
- JSON, OS, sys, platform, uuid (configuration & system info)
- Cryptography (Fernet, HMAC, hashlib, base64)
- datetime, time (scheduling & expiry check)
- webbrowser (open links)

## Purpose
This project is for **learning purposes only**.  
It uses a sandbox environment (game window) to practice computer vision and automation techniques.
